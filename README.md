# Project Name: Phishing E-mail detection and reply system powered by LLMs

## Introduction:
This project features the utilization of advanced deep learning methodologies, specifically Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in conjunction with Mistral 7B Instruct - a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM), to detect and counter phishing emails. Our work encompasses data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, followed by the evaluation of the model's performance in classifying emails accurately. Furthermore, we showcase responses generated based on the provided input and prompt template. The results indicate that the BERT-based model achieved 99.3\% accuracy in distinguishing between phishing and non-phishing emails.
## Features:
- **Email classification:** We created and trained a BERT model capable of classifying emails with 99.3% accuracy.
- **Reply generation:** We use Mistral 7B Instruct to generate replies based on the provided email.

## Installation:
1. **Clone the repository:** `git clone https://github.com/mrmrjing/PhishingEmailClassification.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** `cd PhishingEmailClassification`
3. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. **Run the Antiphishing System Jupiter notebook**

*Warning* running the program for the first time will trigger a download of the Mistral 7B model, which takes ~5GB of disk space.
*Warning v2*
