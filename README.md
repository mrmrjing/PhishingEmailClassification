# Project Name: Phishing E-mail detection and reply system powered by LLMs

## Introduction:
the utilization of advanced deep learning methodologies, specifically Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), in conjunction with Mistral 7B Instruct - a sophisticated Large Language Model (LLM), to detect and counter phishing emails. Our work encompasses data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training, followed by the evaluation of the model's performance in classifying emails accurately. Furthermore, we showcase responses generated based on the provided input and prompt template. The results indicate that the BERT-based model achieved 99.3\% accuracy in distinguishing between phishing and non-phishing emails.
## Features:
- **File management:** Copy, move, rename, and delete files and directories.
- **Text processing:** Search, replace, and manipulate text within files.
- **Data analysis:** Perform basic statistical analysis on CSV files.
- **Customizable:** Easily extend functionality through plugins.
